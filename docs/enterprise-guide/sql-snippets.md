# SQL snippet folders 

SQL snippet **folders** are an Enterprise feature for keeping snippets organized. 

## Folders

Folders work as you would expect. You can add snippets to folders, and nest folders (i.e. create a folder, and put a subfolder in that folder, which itself has a subfolder, etc.).

### Create new SQL snippet folder

You can create a SQL snippet folder from the SQL Snippet menu in the SQL editor.

1. Click on the SQL Snippet menu icon (looks like paragraph text with three uneven horizontal lines).
2. Click on the `+` and select `New folder`
3. Give your folder a name, add a description, and place the folder (if you want to nest that folder in an existing folder.)

You can set permissions to folders to restrict access to SQL snippet folders. If you're familiar with how collections.
